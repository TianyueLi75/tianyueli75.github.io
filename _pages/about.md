<!--[academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)
[_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml)

Getting started
======
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section 

The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

**Markdown generator**
(https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) 
I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.

I am a PhD candidate in Applied and Interdisciplinary Math (AIM) and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I started my PhD program in Fall of 2023, after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley with a degree in Applied Math with a concentration in quantum mechanics. I am also a 2023-2024 Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE) Fellow. I am co-advised by [Prof. Shravan Veerapaneni](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~shravan/) and [Prof. Eric Michielssen](https://michielssen.engin.umich.edu/).

My research is in developing fast and accurate Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) methods for simulating flow-structure and flow-particle interactions in the low-Reynold's number regime. In particular, we aim to better resolve complex physical constraints such as complicated geometry or periodicity. My current projects focus on improving forward solvers in optimization problems on channel or swimmer shape involving special geometry -- in particular structures and particles with circular cross-sections.

As a Graduate Student Instructor (GSI), I have taught the introductory Calculus sequence (Math 115, 116) at the University of Michigan for multiple sememsters, in both group and individual section settings.

Outside of math, I enjoy a lot of outdoor and indoor activities. When the weather holds up, I enjoy going on runs, hikes, or simply walking along the [Border to Border trail](https://www.washtenaw.org/334/Border-to-Border-Trail). I play tennis, and I dabble in alpine, cross-country skiing, and figure skating. When it's dark or rainy, I enjoy watching detective/crime movies and shows, reading memoirs, and doing puzzles.
